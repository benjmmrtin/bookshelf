Models are the backbone of Bookshelf. They encapsulate most of the functionality that you'll need to work with your
data.

### Events

There are several events fired by models at different stages of the query request process. For more information about
this see the {@tutorial events} guide.

**Note**: This section of the documentation is still a WIP. For more in-depth information about models check out the
{@link Model API Reference}.
